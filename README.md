# Till-F

Till-F is a system to manage workout plan, to record training datas and show your progress.

## Problem

Is common that almost all the people use their mobile devices (or even a paper) to take notes of the variants on their workout. We have to take note of the number of repetition that we did, the weight that we had lifted, the minutes that we spent on the break between the repetitions, etc.

It works fine. But one thing that is really hard to check with this approach is the data of old training days. We know when we progress and, even, when we regress, but only comparing with the last trainings. The ones that we did a long time a go are not on this comparison.

## Proposal

The main idea of the Till-F is exaclty to solve this problem. Record all the data of your training days and make it available for you, whenever you want. And even more: give you some cool indicators of your training's historic with the power of graphics, insights and reports.

## How it works

I know you already register your workout plan somewhere and input all the notes of your training. From now on, you will do it on Till-F. You can do it while you're training, or later. And that's the only thing that you need to do.

So, Till-F is going to process the data that you inputed and generate some graphics and reports.

## How to start

Access [the web site](tillf.com.br), create your user, add your workout plan and start to register the training variants.

See you in gym! ðŸ’ª
